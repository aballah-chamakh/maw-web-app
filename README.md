# Mawlety Order Sync – Full-Stack App

**Mawlety Order Sync** is a full-stack application built with **Django** and **React.js** that automates the end‑to‑end order workflow for the brand **Mawlety**. The application loads orders directly from the Mawlety PrestaShop store, saves them into its own database, and automatically submits them to Mawlety's carrier platform. It then continuously synchronizes the statuses by comparing the orders submitted from the app with their corresponding orders on the carrier platform and updates the status on the Mawlety store whenever a difference is detected. This eliminates manual syncing and ensures full alignment between the store and the carrier system.
