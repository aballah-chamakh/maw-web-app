RULE FOR SETTINGS : WE ONLY PUT PARAMETERS THAT MAY CHANGE  : 

THE START LIST OF SETTING TO INCLUDE : 
1- grabbing and inserting state 
2- carrier state to maw state converter
3- loxbox and afex login credentials 
4- maw api key 

THE END LIST : 

3- loxbox and afex login credentials 
4- maw api key 

EXPLANATIONS:  

- why i removed the grabbing and the inserting state from the settings : 
	- because the delivery lifecycle of the order in mawlety states is standard and will not change so the the grabbing 
	  state and the removing state 
	- THE DELIVERY LIFECICLE OF THE ORDER IN MAW STATES
	 	1- the order is received => intial state 
		2- fatma check her stock and confirm with the customer => validé (GRABBING STATE)
		3- fatma prep the order + insert it to the carrier => en cours de preparation (INSERTING STATE) 
		4- the carrier collect the order => Expédié
		5- after all these steps we have 3 outcomes : annulé,livré,retour 

- why i removed carrier state to maw state converter from the settings : 
	given that :
	1- delivery lifecycle of the order in mawlety states is a standard COD cycle and will not change
	2- delivery lifecycle of the order in carrier states is standard COD cycle and will not change
	=> the conversion from carrier state to maw state will always be same 

- why i kept the login credentials in the settings : 
	- because they may change any time 

- why i kept the maw api key in the settings : 
	- for the following low probability reasons  : 
		1- the db get deleted because of a hack and the backup can't help 
		2- i want to change the permissions of the api key 
		3- we need to change the server 
	- even those reason have a low probability i will keep for the following reasons  : 
 		1- it doesn't take much time to make it happen 

SECURITY NOTES :
	- i will make the passwords hidden in the the interface for the people around fatma don't see the passwords and the api key 
	- when fatma hire another person tell her to not give him access to the software because he may stole the db so the credentials
	  and the api key  
 

(SIDE EXPLANATION)
- why i converted "Annulé" in carrier state into "Annulé" in maw state and not "Retour" : 
	- because they have "Annulé" have a different meaning / case than "Retour"
	- the meaning of "Annulé" after the order being inserted into the carrier platform is :  
		when the customer canceled his order before order reach the customer 
	- if the case above does exist "Annulé" will be same as "Retour" which mean the order reached the customer home 
	  but for some reason he didn't get it
