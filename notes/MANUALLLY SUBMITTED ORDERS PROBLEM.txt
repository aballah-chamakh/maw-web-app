THE PROBLEM OF MANUALLY SUBMITTED ORDERS  :
 1- FATMA VALIDATE THE ORDER
 2- FATMA INSERT ORDER INTO LOXBOX MANUALLY 
 3- FATMA RUN THE PROG 
 => THE ABOVE SCENARIO WILL CAUSE THE SAME ORDER TO BE RE-SUBMITTED

BRAINSTORM HOW TO CHECK IF THERE ARE ANY ORDER WAS RESUBMITTED FROM THE ABOVE SCENARIO 
1- THE PERIOD WHEN I MAY RE-SUBMITTED A DUPLICATE ORDER IS WHEN I STARTED SUBMITTING ORDERS WITH SOFTWARE WHICH IS : 
   FROM  : 01/01/2023
   TO    : 05/01/2023 
2- THE ORDERS THAT I MAY DUPLICATE IN LOXBOX ARE ORDERS CREATED IN MAWLETY BETWEEN 31/12/2022 AND 05/01/2023 BECAUSE THE 
   SOFTWARE LOAD ORDERS FROM MAWLETY FROM THIS PERIOD 
3- GIVEN 2 THE ORDERS THAT I MAY DUPLICATED IN LOXBOX ARE ORDERS CREATED BETWEEN 31/12/2022 AND 05/01/2023
  

TO DO : 
1- COLLECT ORDERS WHOSE CREATED MANUALLY BETWEEN 31/12/2022 AND 05/01/2023

2- CHECK IF THE ABOVE ORDERS ARE DUBLICATED BETWEEN 01/01/2023 AND 05/01/2023
- THERE IS NO DUPLICATED ORDERS 

HOW TO ELIMINATE DUBLICATED ORDERS CAUSED FROM THE ORDER BEING INSERTED MANUALLY BEFORE  : 
1- AUTOMATICALLY (STILL NO SURE IF THIS METHOD HAVE NO EXCEPTIONS)
	1- GRAB MANUALLY INSERTED ORDERS  FROM THE DATE OF THE OLDEST CREATED ORDERS FROM THE BATCH OF ORDERS THAT WILL BE SUBMITTED 
	2- FOR EACH NON RELAY ORDER WILL BE SUBMITTED CHECK IF HE EXIST IN THE LIST OF MANUALLY INSERTED ORDERS BY EMAIL , IF HE EXIST DON'T INSERT IT
2- MANUALLY 
	- TELL FATMA TO NOT INSERT ORDERS MANUALLY EXCEPT FOR THE EXCHANGE ONES 


-WHY EXCHANGE ORDERS WHOSE INSERTE MANUALLY DON'T CAUSE ANY PROBLEM 
	- BECAUSE THE EXCHANGE ORDER WAS ALREADY SUBMITTED AUTOMATICALLY SO WILL NOT BE RESUBMITTED AGAIN ALSO THE DUPLICATION 
          OF ORDERS HERE IS ON HIS PLACE
