1- THE INITAL PROBLEM 
THE NON RELAY POINT ORDERS WHO DON'T HAVE A VALID VALUE AT ANY ADDRESS LEVEL THEY WERE CONSIDERED AS A LOXBOX RELAY POINT ORDERS 
, WHICH IS WRONG BECAUSE THERE IS OLD ACCOUNTS WITH NON VALID VALUES AT ANY ADDRESS LEVEL WHO DON'T BELONG TO LOXBOX AREAS AT ALL
2- STEPS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM 
  1- CONSIDER ONLY THE ORDERS WHO HAVE TRANSACTION IDS AS LOXBOX RELAY POINT ORDERS 
  2- LIST THE LOGICAL ADDRESSES CASES : 
     THE PROCESS OF FINDING ONLY THE VALID CASES 
	1- GIVEN THAT WE A 3 ADDRESS LEVELS AND BINARY VALUE FOR THE VALIDITY FOR EACH ADDRESS LEVEL, VALID OR INVALID
           WE WILL END UP WITH 8 CASES 
                 CITY       DELEGATION        LOCALITY
           C0    INVALID    INVALID           INVALID         
	   C1    INVALID    INVALID           VALID 
	   C2    INVALID    VALID             INVALID 
           C3    INVALID    VALID             VALID 
	   C4    VALID      INVALID           INVALID 
	   C5    VALID      INVALID           VALID 
           C6    VALID      VALID             INVALID 
	   C7    VALID      VALID             VALID 
        2- GIVEN THE FOLLOWING RULE FOR A LOGICAL ADDRESS : "AN ADDRESS CASE CONSIDERED VALID ONLY WHEN ANY ONEOF HIS ADDRESS LEVELS 
	   IS INVALID ALL THE ADDRESS LEVELS BELOW IT SHOULD BE INVALID" , IF WE FOLLOW THIS RULE WE WILL END UP ONLY WITH THE FOLLOWING
	   4 CASES : 
           C0    INVALID    INVALID           INVALID   
   	   C4    VALID      INVALID           INVALID   
	   C6    VALID      VALID             INVALID 
           C7    VALID      VALID             VALID 
	   NOTE : FOR C6 OTHER THAN HE FOLLOW THE RULE , THIS CASE IS A VALID CASE BECAUSE THERE WAS PERIOD WHEN WE HAD 
                  ONLY CITY AND DELEGATION AND NO LOCALITY
        3- TELL THE USER ABOUT THE INVALID ADDRESSES 
           - FOR EACH ORDER ADDRESS CHECK IF ANY OF HIS ADDRESS LEVELS ARE INVALID THEN TELL IT TO THE USER THROUGHT A POPUP
           - NOTE : WHEN WE GONNA TELL THE USER THAT THE ADDRESS IS NOT VALID HE MAY GO TO CHECK IT AND PRECEIVE IT AS VALID 
             ON THE THE HOLE ADDRESS LEVEL OR ON THE ADDRESS LEVEL LEVEL: 
                 ON THE HOLE ADDRESS LEVEL: 
             	    1- C4    VALID      INVALID           INVALID  AND THE DELEGATION AND THE LOCALITY ARE EMPTY
		    2- C6    VALID      VALID             INVALID  AND THE LOCALITY IS EMPTY OR HAS A VALUE OTHE THEN "Aucune ... "
                 ON THE ADDRESS LEVEL LEVEL :
                    1- FOR THE CITY : WHEN THE VALUE OF THE CITY IS CLOSE TO THE ONE OF THE VALID CITIES 
                    2- FOR THE DELEGATION AND LOCALITY : WHEN THE ADDRESS LEVEL ABOVE THEM IS VALID AND THAY ARE EMPTY 
                       OR THEY HAVE A VALUE OTHER THAN "Aucune ... "
	     AND TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE SHOULD FOR :
	     	- THE VALUES OTHER THAN "Aucune ... " :  ADD (INVALID)
	     	- THE EMPTY VALUES : ADD (INVALID) IN THE LABEL 
             	NOTE : I WILL IMPLEMENT THIS SOLUTION LATER WHEN IM GONNA COMMERCIALIZE THE SOFTWARE , FOR NOW IM GONNA JUST 
                       TELL THE USER IN THE POPUP THE INVALID ADDRESS LEVELS

NOTE : 
 - BECAUSE THERE IS SOME VALUES OF CITIES OR DELEGATION WHO NEED ONLY TRIMING OR CAPITALIZATION OR BOTH OF THEM TO BECOME VALID 
   WHEN WE ARE CHECKING IF THE ADDRESS IS VALID ADD A CAPITALIZATION AND A TRIMMING TO HANDLE THOSE CASES , ALSO WHEN WE ARE SUBMITTING 
   ORDERS CONSIDER AT LEAST CAPITALIZING THOSE VALUES
 - WHY NOT ALSO THE LOCALITIES ?? : BECAUSE BEFORE WE USED TO WORK WITH A STANDART OF CITIES AND DELEGATION THEN WE MOVED TO ANOTHER
   STANDART WHITH DIFFERENT VALUES OF CITIES AND DELEGATION ALSO THIS NEW STANDART INCLUDE LOCALITIES , GIVEN THAT THE OLD CITIES AND
   DELEGATIONS VALUES MAY NEED ONLY TRIMING OR CAPITALIZATION OR BOTH TO BELONG THE NEW STANDARD BUT LOCALITIES VALUES IF THEY EXIST 
   THEY SHOULD BELONG TO NEW STANDART WHITOUT TRIMING OR CAPITALIZATION BECAUSE WE DIDN'T CHANGE THE LOCALITIES VALUES SINCE WE 
   INTRODUCED LOCALITIES 
- IF AN ADDRESS LEVEL OF AN ORDER BELONG TO LOXBOX AREAS AND EVEN IF THE ADDRESS LEVELS ABOVE HIM ARE NOT VALID 
  JUST WE WILL SUBMIT IT TO LOXBOX BECAUSE LOXBOX DON'T CARE  
	   
             
LAST UPDATE NOTE 
- IN THE NEW DB WE DID IMEDIATLY SET THE LAST STANDARD OF CITY DELEGATION LOCALITY BECAUSE ALL THE DELEGATION 
  OF THE NEW DB ARE VALID 
- BECAUSE ALL THE DELEGATIONS ARE VALID WE DON'T NEED TO TTTLE THEM WHEN WE ARE GRABBING ORDERS FROM 
  MAWLETY
