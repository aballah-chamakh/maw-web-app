IN THE MONITORING PROCESS OF AFEX
1- IF THE THE AFEX TO MAW STATE CONVERTER RETURN A VALUE IT MEAN HE IS WORKING PERFECTLY BECAUSE ONE OF THE NOTED AFEX STATE 
   IS IN THE AFEX STATE OF THE ORDER , OTHERWISE IF IT EQUAL TO NONE IT MEAN THERE IS A NEW STATE IN AFEX THAT IS NOT NOTED 
2- THE ONLY UPDATE CAN HAPPEN IN THE MONITORING PROCESS OF AFEX IS IN THE AFEX TO MAW STATE CONVERTER WHEN A ,NON NOTED NEW STATE
   IN AFEX IS ADDED
3- WE DID EVALUATE THE RESULTS OF MONITORING AFEX ORDERS (228 ORDERS) AND EVALUATION RESULT IS PERFECT



IN THE MONITORING PROCESS OF LOXBOX

- WHY I WILL EVALUATE ORDERS WHO WERE CREATED BETWEEN 31 AN 07 WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS 
  1- THE ORDERS I SHOULD EVALUATE IN LOXBOX ARE THE LX ORDERS WHO ENTERED THE MONITORING PHASE BEFORE 
  2- THE LX ORDERS WHO ENTERED THE MONITORING ARE THE ORDERS WHO WERE LOADED BY THE ORDERS LOADER 
  3- THE ORDERS LOADED BY THE ORDERS LOADERS  WERE LOADED BETWEEN THE 31 AND 07 
     (why not from 30 ??: 
	because i have no lx order created at 30 in mawlety whose state valid + , which mean was entered to the monitoring phase 
        before 
     )
  4- THOSE ORDERS LOADED BETWEEN 31 AND 07 THEY WERE CREATED IN LOXBOX BETWEEN 
     31 AND 07 
     31 : relay point orders 
     01 - 07 : relay point orders + system orders   
  5- EXCEPTION ORDERS : 
	- TEST ORDERS 
        - RELAY ORDERS WHO DIDN'T THE MONITORING PHASE 
        - ORDERS ENTERED BY FATMA


WHY IN LOXBOX I CHANGED THE CONVERTER 
1- THE PROBLEM WITH THE EXISTING CONVERTER 
   THE EXISTING CONVERTER WAS CARD STATE ID TO MAWLETY STATE ID CONVERTER THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS A STATE ID MAY CHANGE HIS 
   MEANING 
   EXAMPLE :
            -2 CARDS SWITCH THEIR NAMES BUT NOT THEIR IDS
2- THE SOLUTION
   CARD STATE NAME TO MAWLETY STATE CONVERTER IN THIS WAY EVEN IF THE MEANING OF A STATE ID CHANGES IF HER NAME IS ONE OF THE 
   EXISTING NAMES IT WILL CONVERT TO RIGHT MAWLETY STATE 

WHAT HAPPEN WHEN THE CONVERTER DIDN'T CONVERT  : 
- IT HAS ONE OF THE TWO MEANNINGS : 
    1- A DIFFERENT EXPERESSION FOR AN EXISTING STATE => I SHOULD ADD IT MANNUALLY
       HERE I DIDN'T WANT TO ADD AUTOMATIC MATCHING IT MAY GO WRONG FOR A REASON DIND'T COME TO MY MIND 
    2- A NEW STATE STATE IN HIS WORKFLOW => I SHOULD ADD IT MANNUALLY
